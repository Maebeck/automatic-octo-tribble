          <h4>ATR 42</h4>
          <p class="aircraft-item-summary">The ATR 42 is a twin-turboprop, short- to medium-haul regional airliner. The
            aircraft performs well at high
            altitude and in hot climates and is suitable for short runway operations. In mid-2000, ATR launched a
            freighter conversion program for both the -42 and -72, involving installing a forward freight door and
            modifying the cabin for freight.</p>

          <h4>Ilyushin IL76</h4>
          <p class="aircraft-item-summary">The Ilyushin Il-76 is a multi-purpose four-engine turbofan medium to long
            range
            freighter. It was designed to deliver heavy machinery to remote, poorly served areas. The Il-76 has seen
            extensive service as a commercial freighter for ramp-delivered cargo, especially for outsized or heavy items
            unable to be otherwise carried. Because of its ability to operate from unpaved runways, it has been useful
            in
            undeveloped areas. Its highlight is an internal winch system that can pull the cargo inside with a max.
            weight
            of 10t. per piece.</p>

            to long-haul flights. It has been developed in different versions. TU-204 freighters fitted are with a
            forward
            main deck freight door. It was the first Russian/CIS built aircraft to hold an EASA aircraft type
            certification. It can fly for long distances without intermediate stops for refuelling. Its floor is fitted
            with roller beds for easy handling of cargo and ideal for transporting freight in pallets.</p>

            engines. It is the largest
            aircraft with the widest wingspan of any aircraft in operational service in the world. It is mainly used for
            special missions with extraordinary cargo with high payload and volume capability.</p>
