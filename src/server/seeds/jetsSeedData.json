      altitude and in hot climates and is suitable for short runway operations. In mid-2000, ATR launched a freighter
      conversion program for both the -42 and -72, involving installing a forward freight door and modifying the cabin for
      freight.",

      "description": "The Ilyushin Il-76 is a multi-purpose four-engine turbofan medium to long range freighter. It was designed to
      deliver heavy machinery to remote, poorly served areas. The Il-76 has seen extensive service as a commercial
      freighter for ramp-delivered cargo, especially for outsized or heavy items unable to be otherwise carried. Because
      of its ability to operate from unpaved runways, it has been useful in undeveloped areas. Its highlight is an
      internal winch system that can pull the cargo inside with a max. weight of 10t. per piece.",
